						<h2 style="color:#a62526;" >Conclusion</h2>
						<p> All the ideal jobs insist on a number of core skills. The most prominant of these being
							  Communication skills and the ability to work in teams.

								<blockquote cite="http://autismworkbarrier.org.uk/articles/good-communication-skills">
									56% of jobs requires good communication and interpersonal skills while 33% require
									‘excellent communication skills’  <a href="#section1">[1]</a>
								</blockquote>

						<p> After this the jobs tend to specialise. Most require programming skills, one predominantly requires
							  system testing abilities and the other centres around in-home customer support.<br>
								Education requirements: An undergraduate degree is a minimum for all positions. However
								one position requires a Masters Degree.<br>
								Career Paths: All team members wish to complete their undergraduate degree. After this all members plan
								different strategies. These range from no further studies to completing and Honours and Masters degrees.

										<h2> Cyber security</h2>

										<p> Cyber security is the method or practice of defending: networks, computers, servers, mobile devices, 
											other forms of technology and data from malicious attackers. Cyber security is often referred to as “Information Security” 
											or “Information technology security” however they do slightly differ from one another. 
											Generally speaking, cyber security encompasses multiple different terminologies, technologies and defensive countermeasures that 
											together form the umbrella term of “cyber security.” Some of these technologies and methods are outlined below:
											</p>

										<button class="accordion" style = border:solid 1px;>More Information</button>
										<div class="panel">
										<p>
											<ul> 
												<li>
													Network security: Network security encompasses the methods and technologies (such as Network intrusion prevention and detection systems, 
													firewalls and network authenticity methods) to secure networks from unwanted or unpermitted parties from accessing the network.
												</li>
													<br>
												<li>
												Application Security: Application security is the process and ability of ensuring applications and software remain safe for users
												 and remain threat free. Application security should be considered during the design of the application in question, issues, potential
												  vulnerabilities and threats should be identified and addressed accordingly, application security also ensures the integrity of data and 
												  user / private information handled and stored by the application.
												</li>
													<br>
												<li>
													Information security: Information Security is a broader category of security than cyber; however, they are closely related.  
													Information security relates to the protection of information in physical and digital form, the two relate in the digital realm where information
													 may be passed through networking, applications, or other online services. (for example your credit card information when purchasing something 
													 online).
												</li>
												<br>
											</ul>
										
											<p>Cyber security is an ever-evolving group of technologies, with the origins of the field being sceptical and debatable 
											however cyber security did start to become an emerging technology in the late 70’s and early 80’s with the first viruses (worms) 
											being created and released around this time. <br>
											The field came into prominence during the late 80’s and early 90’s as an early and relatively undefended Internet started to become more popular
											 as the number of people connecting increased, malicious actors who would become to be known as “cyber criminals” realised that they could earn money by stealing data,
											  and other forms of personal data often extorting the victim in-exchange for the release of their information. 
											  During this period there was an explosion of companies offering security services to customers,
											  <a href="https://www.eset.com/au/">Nod32</a>, <a href="https://au.norton.com">Norton</a>, and  <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/index.html">Mcafee</a> where among the first and most popular. Over time billions of dollars and countless hours of research, development and collaboration where spent to advance technologies, construct counter measures and enforce unity amongst Internet protocols to ensure that the end user and the various forms of data utilised today are kept safe.

									<u>	<h1> Interview with an IT Professional </h1> </u>
	
									<p>Our report is based on an interview with Guy Gershoni (Manager - MYOB Australia)
										conducted on Wednesday 7th April 2021. </p>
	
									<p>We would like to express our deepest appreciation to Guy for his kind assistance in making
										 this report possible.</p>
	
									<p>	Note:  <br>
										  Before the meeting, Guy gave us permission to record visually, orally and as a transcript.
											He also gave us permission to be quoted by name.
											We have provided him with a copy of the report before submission.<br>
											A transcript of the interview can be found [here]:
	
	
	
	
									<h2>Reflection</h2>
									<p> The interview went well in general. Guys's stories were enlightening not only were they full of
										  information, but were also easy to understand. We enjoyed the interview, because we got to know a
											sliver of Guy’s experience and observed his passion for IT. On reflection, what we learned from
											the interview, it is clear that the IT industry presents many interesting opportunities but also has its unique
											challenges. The main thing that we learned from Guy is "whether you're working in different areas,
											or in different fields, there's still core ideas and core principles that you bring to each job
											which evolve over the years". The other fascinating ascpect that Guy told us is "it never stays stagnant, there's always new things on
											the block". We have a much greater appreciation that the IT industry is ever-changing meaning that we always have to learn something new to keep up with the industry, 
											even though they are based on solid principles that change less over the years. The good thing about this situation is that as long as we continue to learn, the job over our lifetimes will be many and varied.</p>
	
									<h3 style="color:#a62526;">What kind of work is done by I.T. Professional</h3>
									<p> Guy is an Engineering Manager, and he is responsible for managing a team that is improving and supporting some infrastructure aspects of MYOB’s technology. 
										He runs a team of approximately 15 people and they are regularly improving hand-written Kubernetes elements that were written a few years ago and now are being superseded by 
										Amazon Web Services (AWS) components.  He is focused on having the team modernize and simplify the technology stack. 
										A lot of his work is spent coordinating his team, understanding what is happening, and mediating between different parties to ensure a good result is delivered. 
										He ensures that he hires smart and capable people, and enables them to be independent by providing context and guiding them in the right direction. 
										He believes that the team of specialists should be autonomous rather than micro-managed, ensuring a good reliability and performance of the systems they deliver.</p>
	
								 <h3 style="color:#a62526;">Who do I.T. professional interact with?</h3>
									<p>Guy’s interactions are limited to MYOB’s internal teams, and he does not have opportunity to interact with different companies, clients, or accountants.
										Guy’s team is an internal service provider for other teams in MYOB.  This is because the technology he delivers is the framework of systems and 
										infrastructure that enable the other MYOB technology teams to operate. 
										In this way, the other MYOB teams are internal clients who have high expectations of him. 
										
										As an internal service provider, 
										he receives specifications from different teams and
										must negotiate, discuss, and deliver products that the teams require.
										
										As a manager, he interacts with his own team members to deliver on the specifications required, 
										involving supporting and directing the team, and mediating issues both within the team and with internal customers’ requirements.</p>
	
								 <h3 style="color:#a62526;">Where do I.T. professional spend most of the time?</h3>
								 <p> Guy spends most of his time doing managerial tasks that are focused on ensuring that his teams are working effectively. 
									 He is responsible for three different teams covering:
										1.On premise support – as there are legacy platforms that are yet to be moved to the cloud, this team must continue to ensure the system is reliable and maintained.
										2.Kubernetes cluster – this compute cluster supports more than 200 million requests a month, but only has four team members.
										3.Design Systems – this team maintains a Javascript library that is used by the rest of the company to give a consistent look and feel and avoid different solutions to the same problem. 

									As a manager, Guy must coordinate his team but also deal with complex issues that may have multiple solutions and opinions that have to be mediated.  
									We could hear from talking with Guy that dealing with three very different teams and internal stakeholders was a lot of work.</p>
	
								<h3 style="color:#a62526;">What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h3>
								<p> Guy divided his challenges into two elements - technical and managerial.<br>
									  <u>	Technical: </u>The technical challenge is to understand complex problems and then determine the best way to provide a solution, within the environment which they work. 
										Often there is a trade-off between the short-term resolution and redesigning the whole system which is a far larger task. 
										As an example, many of the hand-written Kubernetes items can now be easily delivered by standard AWS components, but there is work to be done to make this transition. <br>
									  <u>	Managerial:</u> The managerial challenge is to have enough technical skill to understand problems in less than 20 minutes, 
										and guide teams to come up with a solution and sometimes arbitrate different solutions between team members. 
										Guy found that some of the technical team members had regular disagreements over code, and he had to help resolve the differences between the people. 
										He finds that he has to plan how he can keep the team “humming well” so that they continue to provide value to the business.
										Guy mentioned a book: “Turn The Ship Around!”[1] written by a Captain of a nuclear
										submarine in the US Navy. The captain created autonomy in the boat’s teams, thereby turning his
										boat from one of the worst performing to one of the best.  Guy added that he is trying to apply
										this managerial style to his teams vis-a-vis the command-and-control model. As Guy stated: <br>
									“If I’m doing my job well, it means the teams look after themselves and can deal with the clients
									  themselves and I can watch cat videos” </p>
	
								<h3 style="color:#a62526;">How do they keep their technology skills current?</h3>
								<p>	Guy listed a number of places / strategies that he uses for keeping up to date.<br>
								 </ul>
									  <li>“Slashdot.org” a “News for Nerds” site which he reads every day, to learn the latest trends.</li>
									  <li>Attend conferences like YAO  (Young Atom Optician). A platform to learn from and extend
											his network with peers.</li>
									  <li>Guy also does side projects with friends. He usually have one or two projects going at any one time.
											Whilst these projects haven't yet resulted in a “billion-dollar startup” he’s learned many
											skills that helped get him the next job.</li>
								</ul></p>
	
								<h3 style="color:#a62526;">Can they share an example that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h3>
								<p>Guy recalled a project going back 10 years. <br>
									 The on-line platform they created was for Associated Retailers Limited to allow their franchisees
									 (Toy World, Men’s Land, Sports Power etc) to order stock. Prior to this, franchisees had to order
									 stock manually over the phone or by posting spreadsheets.<br>
									 The platform developed was a B-to-B e-commerce site. Guy added that one of the most interesting
									 aspects of the platform was designing the respective interfaces (layouts, fonts, colours etc),
									 which had to cater for variances between franchisees that expected it to be adaptable to all their
									 individual needs.<br>
									 The platform was then integrated into the stores Point of Sale (POS) systems so that ordering
									 became almost automatic. <br>
									 Guy added that one of the spin offs from the system was the amount of information now available online.
									 Then it was called “Business Intelligence”, now it’s called “Data Analytics”.
									 Businesses can now see patterns and trends and react accordingly.</p>

										Guy Gershoni Engineer Manager - MYOB Australia (Interviewee)</p>
	
						<p>We would like to express our deepest appreciation to Guy Gershoni for his contribution to this article.<br>
						Before the meeting Guy gave us permission to record the meeting which we did.
						He also stated that he would be happy if he is quoted by name.
						We have provided him with a copy of the report before this publication.</p>
	
	
	
						<p><b><u>Question: What aspect of their job they find the most challenging? </b></u>
						<p><b><u>Answer:</b></u> Guy divided it into two elements, which is the technical and managerial part as an
						Engineer Manager.The challenging part of the technical aspect is he is still involved in people management,
						planning and strategic work. It’s what they call “Level 3” work. Understanding and providing solutions or
						insights to overcome a problem. Guy said what he finds really challenging as an Engineering Manager is being
						able to communicate effectively with the business and understand what they business is trying to do.
						Understand the capabilities and opportunities in the teams and then working out how to build a plan
						where he can provide value to the business and keep the team sort of “humming well”. </p>
	
						<p><b><u>Question: Please tell us about your IT work </b></u>
						<p><b><u>Answer:</b></u> I work at MYOB at the moment, so we basically run a couple of million customers now
						and we look after Australia and New Zealand financial services for companies a lot more than just small
						businesses. We do run enterprise businesses, financial services. We do a lot of work with accountants and
						practitioners so. The company is not small. I think we have got about 1000 IT developers and people who work
						in IT and then probably another thousand who do customer support sales and marketing, legal and others. So,
						it’s a big small company. </p>
	
						<p><b><u>Question:	Where do you spend most of you time? </b></u>
						<p><b><u>Answer:</b></u> here I work, I look after a couple of teams that basically look after the
						infrastructure for the team. So, we provide the platforms and the services that other teams use for delivering
						the products to the end customers. So, I got one team that looks after some of we still have on Prem in
						2021 that we are aggressively moving that into the cloud. We’ve got another team that has a what they call
						a Kubernetes cluster so it’s sort of ephemeral compute sort of cluster that we run. It’s one of the largest
						in Australia, does about 200,000,000 requests a month, and that’s a team of only four people at the moment
						trying to grow that out. And I also look after another team called the “Design Systems Team” and what they
						do is build a library, like JavaScript library that is used by the rest of the company to build various
						applications/ online applications and it gives everyone a consistent look and feel. Previous to this group,
						MYOB has quite a number of products that they’ve acquired and built over the years. There was something
						like 17 different date pickers or something, so they wanted to create a consistent experience as a customer
						moves from one experience to another. So, one product to another. So, the transition isn’t jarring because
						the look and feel is still consistent, so those are the teams that I look after. </p>
	
	
						<p><b><u>Question:	What’s your interaction like with clients? Who are the different people you work with and
																can you please tell us about them? </b></u>
						<p><b><u>Answer:</b></u> I’m away at this stage of my career, so when you say clients, I don’t work with the
						accountants and small businesses owners, but our clients are the people who are using our platforms and I work
						a lot with them, so I’ll work a lot with sort of the various other teams and understand what’s going on and
						mediate between. I have to balance the work that the teams need to get done to maintain the current level of,
						reliability and performance in the systems with the feature requests and bug fixes that need to be done for
						another requested by the client. So even though I don’t work with the end customer per say, our team still
						have a lot of clients that we deal with. There’s a very good book called “Turn the ship around” which is about
						a captain of a nuclear submarine in the American Navy, and he sort of talks about essentially creating
						autonomy in teams. So, if I’m doing my job well, it means the teams look after themselves and can deal with
						the clients themselves and I can watch cat videos, I think that’s a big shift in IT management over the last
						sort of 10-15 years. Has been from a command-and-control kind of mechanism. You know I am the boss and I know
						everything that’s going on. I remember in Telstra getting in trouble because I hired a guy with a double
						degree ANU in computer vision and mathematics and for some reason I didn’t know everything he did everyday
						and my boss was upset. You know it’s a command-in-control and now my job is to hire people smarter more
						capable than myself. Which is getting easier and easier over the years. Essentially giving those teams the
						autonomy, so I don’t tell people what to do. I provide them with enough context for them to try and work out
						what the right decisions are. </p>
	
						<p><b><u>Question:	What is your position? </b></u>
						<p><b><u>Answer:</b></u> I’m at an engineering manager level. I look after three teams, about 15 people.
						With IT you can do a lot with small team. And you can get very little done in a very big team </p>
	
						<p><b><u>Question:	How did you begin your career/ How did you become interested in this field?</b></u>
						<p><b><u>Answer:</b></u> I was interested in computer back in the 80’s, mainly because you know I have mild
						dyslexia. SO, I really love the spell checker. That’s sort of how I fell in love with computers and I did a
						bit of programming and was bit of a nerd. Then eventually I actually was more interested in doing Social
						Sciences Anthropology and I took a year off university and then I suddenly realized that having money is a
						good idea, and I eventually transferred into business computing, lots of programming and algorithms but not
						as computer science. And that was great, and I graduated in 1998-1999 just when the bubble was going, I had
						a lot of fun back when everything was kind of mad and then experience the bubble bust and it’s been one of
						those careers that I just have had short periods where sort of come out of it for a few years but then always
						seem to find my way back because the job keeps evolving. It’s a very interesting career, it never stays
						stagnant, there’s always new things on the block. Which have a lot of relevance to what you have been doing,
						so having 20 years of experience gives you a lot of very useful context, and it’s a very international trade.
						I’ve worked in Israel and companies in America and Europe as well, it’s been an interesting career. </p>
	
						<p><b><u>Question:	How do you keep your technology skills current? </b></u>
						<p><b><u>Answer:</b></u> Not as well as I should have, you have to. I have certain resources “Slashdot.org”,
						it’s been around since mid-90’s, and that’s where I got to each day. I sort of checkup and read what’s going
						on from a trend perspective and I also make it a point to work with companies that supports us with training
						budget and I’ll try and attend general conferences like YAO where people talk about various aspects of what’s
						going on in the industry. I also do side hustles, I have my day job and usually have one or two things that
						I poke around with friends, to experiment, the side hustles usually end up, if they don’t become the next
						“Unicorn” or like a billion-dollar startup, I learned some interesting skills that helped me get the next
						job. </p>
	
						<p><b><u>Question:	What kind of technologies, software’s or online resources that you use the most to help
																you do your job? </b></u>
						<p><b><u>Answer:</b></u> In my day job, I have been writing job ads, and we have specific tool called “Textio”,
						that helps us understand how we use our language and what that might affect as far as would it attract people
						of certain age ranges or detract people of certain ranges and genders and etc. We use a tool called “Jira” for
						managing projects and workflows. There’s a couple of custom tools for me to manage like people and HR related
						issues. We use “Slack” a lot for conversation, calling people, meetings, and emails. </p>
	
						<p><b><u>Question:	Which aspect of work do you find most challenging? </b></u>
						<p><b><u>Answer:</b></u> There’s always a technical aspect and even as an engineering manager, most of my day
						is around people management, planning and strategic work. It’s what they call “Level 3” work. I still need
						to be technical enough that the teams can explain to me a problem and I can understand it enough within 10-20
						minutes that I can help them come to a solution or sometimes arbitrate. A team last quarter, they were two guys
						I was looking after and they bicker a lot over code. They have this thing called “pull request” which one will
						write code and then they’ll say I want to merge this into the production code. And the other person reviews
						that code using something like GitHub. They’ll review that code and then they’ll decide whether its good or
						not or what should be changed. And usually this is a great process where developers feel confident because
						there’s other developer’s looking at their code. Some of the really critical systems like “Kubernetes Cluster”
						we actually have on the repository’s that manage that, we actually need two people to approve a pull request,
						not one. We need two sets of eyes, other than the developer to review that code before it goes into production
						anyway, they were arguing so I had to understand enough about what they were trying to do and how they are
						coding to help them come to a compromise in a resolution. So, there’s that engineering part. But I think what
						I find really challenging now is being able to communicate effectively with the business. So, my job right
						now is not as much in the technical realm, its more around trying to understand what the business is trying
						to do. Understand what are the capabilities and opportunity in the teams and then working out how to then
						build some kind of road map or a plan where we sort of can provide value to the business and keep the team
						sort of humming well. </p>
	
						<p><b><u>Question:	What are you working on at the moment? </b></u>
						<p><b><u>Answer:</b></u> One of the interesting projects about IT is in the old days, they used to think was 
						IT was like an infrastructure hardware. Like CapEx [Capital Expenditure] vs OpEx [Operational Expenditure]
						conversation. So, we have the plan, the project and then you build it and then it would go and that’s your 
						CapEx spend and then that’s your OpEx and it would be like business-as-usual mode. And that’s not just the way
						that software works. Unfortunately, you are constantly evolving software, and one of the teams, the Kubernetes
						Team, they rolled out this platform about three years ago and back then there weren’t a lot of tools available.
						They had to do a lot of implementation themselves. They rolled out a lot of the infrastructure themselves.
						What’s happened over the last three years is that Kubernetes is very popular now and we use Amazon Web
						ervices a lot. They have now a lot of services that do what we handcrafted three years ago, and some of the
						work at the moment we’re doing has a lot of planning, investigation and testing before it actually start
						moving things across but were slowly trying to move the world from being stuff that we need to worry about to
						stuff that Amazon Web Services does for us, so that the team can then refocus on building out features and
						fixing problems that the business actually cares about, that is unique to MYOB, not solving a general problem  </p>
	
						<p><b><u>Question:	Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of
																the IT industry? </b></u>
						<p><b><u>Answer:</b></u> I think one of the most successful projects I was involved in and this is going back
						10 years ago. This was for a group called Associated Retailers Limited, they are the back end of Toy World,
						Men’s Land, Sports Power and etc. They are actually the franchisee owners where they run their own “Meredith”,
						where they run their own brands. And our job was to come in and initially was to develop a B-to-B e-commerce
						site. This is back in mid to late 2000’s. It was revolutionary because at that stage prior to that, for
						franchisee owners to order stock was a really painful manual process, where they have to sit there and discuss
						things over the phone or send spreadsheets if they were capable enough and similar other issues involved.
						So, we sort of set up a B-to-B ecommerce site and it was fun because we started with an existing B to C
						ecommerce software but normal consumers don’t order $400,000 worth of stuff with 300-line items on it, so
						there’s all kinds of interesting work there. There was a fashion in that stuff as well, so we have to come
						up with new and interesting user interfaces for people to easily order, e.g., size, color and quantity.
						What was interesting is that then solved an immediate problem of allowing franchisees to order complex
						orders easily but then it started providing all kinds of really useful information because it was a lot
						easier mining the data from that and what we started using that for what was called Business Intelligence
						back then and is now all data analytics now, so that we could understand and start to see that patterns and
						trends, so it was a lot more useful for negotiations and election. Then we also started integrating with their
						point of sales system so we could do automatic ordering and various other tools. And the thing about IT is,
						even so in my career, I’ve been in all kinds of different industries and worked in all different kind of
						systems. Themes seem to come back up, like I’ve had a couple of additional logistics-oriented jobs more than a
						couple of retail-oriented jobs, and I also worked in education a few times so even though you’re working in
						different areas in different fields. There’s still core ideas, core principles that you bring to each job and evolve over the years. </p>
