								<P style="color:white;"> Max, who lives in Cairns North Queensland, is a 25 year old student of RMIT.
									 	He has previously studied a diploma at CQU and worked in the ADF.
									 	His interest in IT started because of his father, who was an IT consultant working from home.
									 	Hence Max was always surrounded by computers and servers.
									 	Knowledge and interest in IT was accelerated during work in the ADF.</p>
								<p style="margin-left: 40px"> “… every second week there was something new;... radios, GPS, commanders tablets,
									 	tracking and positioning gadgets, bore-sight tools were becoming more common place,
									 	everything was starting to become more ‘digital.’” </p>
								<p>	After the Army, Max decided to study IT. He was drawn towards Information security and started some online courses,
									 	such as Comtia Network and linux+ offered at sites such as CYBRARY.IT, EdX and UDEMY.
									 	With these courses Max started to become more interested in programming,
									 	and started taking some courses in learning how to code using CODEACADEMY. </p>
								<p style="margin-left: 40px"> “RMIT has a lot more programming on offer. In particular linux and C++ … [and these] were good selling points…
									 	but I also hope to improve my GUI and graphical design...” <p>

							This passion became the driver to enrol in the RMIT IT Degree. <br>
							Asked what it is about computer programming he likes, he stated: </p>
					<p style="margin-left: 40px"> “… personal satisfaction. It gives me immense joy when presented with a
							programming problem and I ‘nut’ it out, and make things work.” </p>

							‘The Robins’ because of their red shirts).
							Lewis has been married for over 40 years and has one child.</p>

								an Honours and Masters Degree in either software development,
								cyber security, or artificial intelligence would likely be his best course of action.

						<h3 style="color:red;" >Conclusion</h3>
						<p> All the ideal jobs insist on a number of core skills. The most prominant of these being
							  Communication skills and the ability to work in teams.

								<blockquote cite="http://autismworkbarrier.org.uk/articles/good-communication-skills">
									56% of jobs requires good communication and interpersonal skills while 33% require
									‘excellent communication skills’  <a href="#section1">[1]</a>
								</blockquote>

						<p> After this the jobs tend to specialise. Most require programming skills, one predominantly requires
							  system testing abilities and the other centres around in-home customer support.<br>
								Education requirements: An undergraduate degree is a minimum for all positions. However
								one position requires a Masters Degree.<br>
								Career Paths: All team members wish to complete their undergraduate degree. After this all members plan
								different strategies. These range from no further studies to completing and Honours and Masters degrees.
